To translate this add-on

1) Translation software:
   Install an editor for po-files. Popular programms are poedit and lokalize.
   For Windows, Linux, Mac: https://poedit.net/download
   For Linux, one of:
      sudo apt install poedit
      sudo apt install lokalize


2) Translation Files:
   wesnoth-Conquest.pot          For the important things, objectives, unit names, etc
   wesnoth-Conquest_Europe.pot   For names of Cities and Countries.

   Open a file, start translating. Europe file is good for trying out, but the other one is important.

   Two thing which you need to know:
   - For a linebreak, one must type "\n".
   - If there is a $sign, it is a variable. Do keep the name of them as is.
   There are also translation hints in the file ;-)


3) po Files:
   When you save, it will be stored as po-file.
   To see the strings ingame, you can save the file in this location:
   translations/<textomain-name>/<language>.po

   If you for example translate the Europe file into Swedish:
   translations/wesnoth-Conquest_Europe/sv.po

   When restarting Wesnoth or pressing F5 key on the titlescreen,
   then your translation file is read again and your changes become visible.

   If it does not work: File managers often do not display the file extension (the part from the last dot onwards).
   It might be that the file is in reality named sv.po.po ... which is not the correct filename!


4) mo Files:
   These porgramms can also create mo-files. This are machine-optimized files, which you can not read yourself.
   To use these instead, one needs to place them at:
   translations/<language>/LC_MESSAGES/<textdomain-name>.mo

   So, for Arabic it would be:
   translations/ar/LC_MESSAGES/wesnoth-Conquest_Europe.mo

   However, it is good to ocassionally check ingame how your translation looks.
   For example, you can see if the translated name is too long for the place where it is shown.

   This is easier to do when you use the po-file directly.
   (You can use a mo-file optionally when you finished.)
